Title: A Lightweight Reference Object Implementation
Version: 0.0.0.9000
Authors@R: person("Kun", "Ren", email = "ken@renkun.me", role = c("aut", "cre"))
Description: Provides a lightweight implementation of reference object.
    User can 'ref' an R object (such as a vector or list) and pass it to
    a function. Modifications of the object in the function body will
    not make a local copy in order to mimic pass-by-reference of the object.
Depends: R (>= 2.15)
