#' The reflite package
#'
#' reflite provides a lightweight implementation of reference object.
#' User can 'ref' an R object (such as a vector or list) and pass it
#' to a function. Modifications of the object in the function body
#' will not make a local copy in order to mimic pass-by-refernce of
#' the object.
